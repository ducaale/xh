.SH NAME
xh \- Friendly and fast tool for sending HTTP requests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xh
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
[\fIMETHOD\fR]
\fIURL\fR
[\-\-\]
[\fIREQUEST_ITEM\fR ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBxh\fR is an HTTP client with a friendly command line interface. It strives to
have readable output and easy-to-use options.

xh is mostly compatible with HTTPie: see \fBhttp\fR(1).

The \fB--curl\fR option can be used to print a \fBcurl\fR(1) translation of the
command instead of sending a request.

.SH POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP 4
[\fIMETHOD\fR]\fI
The HTTP method to use for the request.

This defaults to GET, or to POST if the request contains a body.
.TP
\fIURL\fR
The URL to request.

The URL scheme defaults to "http://" normally, or "https://" if
the program is invoked as "xhs".

A leading colon works as shorthand for localhost. ":8000" is equivalent
to "localhost:8000", and ":/path" is equivalent to "localhost/path".
.TP
[\fIREQUEST_ITEM\fR ...]
{{request_items}}

Each --OPTION can be reset with a --no-OPTION argument.
